Python - More Classes and Objects
This project explores object-oriented programming in Python and covers topics such as class methods, static methods, class vs. instance attributes, and the use of special methods like __str__ and __repr__.

Tasks
0. Simple rectangle

Implements __str__ to print the rectangle as a string.
4. Eval is magic

Implements __repr__ to return a string representation of the rectangle.
5. Detect instance deletion

Defines a __del__ method that prints a message when a rectangle instance is deleted.
6. How many instances

Adds a class attribute to count instances and handle deletions.
7. Change representation

Introduces a class attribute to customize the symbol used for string representation.
8. Compare rectangles

Adds a static method to compare rectangles based on their areas.
9. A square is a rectangle

A class method to create square instances.
10. N Queens
