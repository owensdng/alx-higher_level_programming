# Python Input/Output

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various aspects of input and output operations in Python. These scripts cover topics such as reading and writing files, JSON serialization and deserialization, and more. I've created these scripts as part of my learning journey to understand how Python handles different input and output operations.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

1. **Read File (0-read_file.py)**: This script reads a text file and prints its contents to the standard output.

2. **Write to a File (1-write_file.py)**: This script writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written.

3. **Append to a File (2-append_write.py)**: This script appends a string to the end of a text file and returns the number of characters added.

4. **To JSON String (3-to_json_string.py)**: This script converts Python data structures to JSON strings.

5. **From JSON String to Object (4-from_json_string.py)**: This script converts JSON strings back into Python objects.

6. **Save Object to a File (5-save_to_json_file.py)**: This script saves Python objects to a file in JSON format.

7. **Create Object from a JSON File (6-load_from_json_file.py)**: This script loads Python objects from a JSON file.

8. **Load, Add, Save (7-add_item.py)**: This script demonstrates how to add items to a list, save them to a file, and load them back.

9. **Class to JSON (8-class_to_json.py)**: This script defines a function to convert Python classes to JSON representations.

10. **Student to JSON (9-student.py)**: This script defines a Student class and a method to convert Student objects to JSON format.

11. **Student to JSON with Filter (10-student.py)**: This script extends the Student class with the ability to filter which attributes to include in the JSON representation.

12. **Student to Disk and Reload (11-student.py)**: This script shows how to save Student objects to disk in JSON format and reload them.

13. **Pascal's Triangle (12-pascal_triangle.py)**: This script generates Pascal's triangle up to a specified number of rows.

14. **Log Parsing (101-stats.py)**: This script reads log data from stdin, computes metrics, and prints statistics, including total file size and the number of lines by status code.

## Usage

You can run these scripts individually to understand and test different input and output operations in Python. Each script is accompanied by a usage example in its description.
